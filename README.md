# MultispeakerTTS

This is going to be a multi-speaker text-to-speech system.  This is still a work in progress, so take everything with a grain of salt.

I referenced [pytorch-kaldi-neural-speaker-embeddings](https://github.com/jefflai108/pytorch-kaldi-neural-speaker-embeddings) when initially creating the speaker embedding to get the LDE network to work.
